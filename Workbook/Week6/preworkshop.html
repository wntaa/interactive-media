                    <li><strong>Silk</strong> emphasizes direct manipulation and immediate feedback, allowing users to actively create flowing patterns through intuitive drawing interactions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Neural Synesthesia</strong> explores the intersection of AI and art, creating a symbiotic relationship between machine learning models and human audio input.</li>
                    <li><strong>Electric Sheep</strong> pioneered distributed collaborative creation, where thousands of computers work together to evolve complex fractal animations guided by collective human aesthetic preferences.</li>

                <p>These works represent a spectrum of user agency in generative art: from direct creation (Silk), to parameter adjustment of AI systems (Neural Synesthesia), to participation in collective evolution (Electric Sheep). They also showcase different technical approaches, from real-time browser-based rendering to distributed computing networks, demonstrating the diverse pathways for creating compelling 3D generative art experiences.</p>
