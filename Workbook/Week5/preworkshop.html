                <p>These three creative coding projects demonstrate innovative approaches to digital mirrors and reflection:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pixelated Mirror</strong> transforms webcam input into a gridded, pixel-art style representation that maintains recognizable forms while abstracting detail.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sequins Mirror</strong> converts video data into interactive circular elements that respond both to the user's appearance and direct manipulation through mouse input.</li>
                    <li><strong>Webcam Experiment</strong> creates artistic distortions of video feed, offering novel ways to visualize human movement and presence.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>All three projects use p5.js as their technical foundation, demonstrating the library's versatility for creative webcam applications. They share a common theme of transforming our self-image through digital processing, creating a dialogue between physical presence and digital representation. These examples show how creative coding can reimagine the concept of mirrors, offering new perspectives on how we see ourselves through technology.</p>
